			<p>In the first part of the study, you will be shown charts about sales of two products in a fictional company, <i>Product A</i> and <i>Product B</i>. You will then be asked to describe each chart in a few sentences.
				Please try to be specific about patterns and details you observe.</p>
			<p>To see the chart, click the <b>Ready</b> button. The input field will appear after a few seconds.</p>
			<p>You will need to enter a minimum number of characters to be able to advance to the next question. This part of the study consists of nine questions.</p>

			<p>In the second part of the study, you will be shown charts similar to the first part. You will then be asked to recreate each chart from memory.
				As before, the charts show the sales prices of two products, A and B, over time.

			<p>You will need to move all of the points in the chart in order to be able to advance to the next question.</p>
